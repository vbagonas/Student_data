# **v3.0**

**Manual**

1. Download .msi file.
2. Run .msi file and download the programme.
3. Run the programme. It should appear on desktop "StudentasApp"

**Help**

1. When you run the programme you can choose how you want to enter data or maybe you want to generate file. If you want to enter data from the file, make sure it's inside the folder. Path of the folder should be seen at the top when you run the programme.
2. Secondly, you can choose by which parameter to filter data.
3. And lastly, your filtered data will occur inside the folder named "RezultataiKietiakai" (average grades >= 5.0) and "RezultataiVargsiukai" (average grades < 5.0)

I have also added one .txt file as an example how the file structure must look like.
